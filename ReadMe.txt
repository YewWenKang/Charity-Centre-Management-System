Volunteer and Event Management System
Overview

The Volunteer and Event Management System is a Java-based application designed to streamline the management of volunteers and events. The system is built to handle various tasks, such as registering volunteers, assigning them to events, and maintaining a record of these activities. This program is particularly useful for organizations that rely heavily on volunteers and need an efficient way to manage them.

Key Features

Volunteer Management:
The VolunteerMaintenance class is responsible for managing all volunteer-related activities. It includes several key functionalities: 
Register New Volunteers: Collect essential details such as name, phone number, email, address, and experience level. Volunteers are assigned a unique ID and stored in VolunteerData.csv.
Delete Volunteers: Easily remove volunteers from the system by their ID. The system ensures data consistency by updating the CSV file upon deletion.
Search Volunteers by ID: Quickly retrieve and display detailed information about any volunteer using their unique ID.
Filter Volunteers by Experience: Display lists of volunteers filtered by their experience level (Experienced/Non-Experienced).
List All Volunteers: View all registered volunteers, complete with their respective details.
The VolunteerMaintenance class utilizes a custom linked list implementation (LinkedList class) to manage the volunteers. This ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of volunteer records. The class also interacts with file handling utilities to read and write CSV files, ensuring that data is persistently stored and easily retrievable.

Event Management:
The EventMaintenance class is responsible for managing events and the volunteers assigned to them. Key functionalities include:
Assign Volunteers to Events: Assign volunteers to specific events based on their ID and prevent duplicate assignments. The system records event data in Event.csv.
View Volunteers by Event: Retrieve a list of all volunteers assigned to a specific event by event name.
The EventMaintenance class also uses a linked list to manage the volunteers assigned to each event. It interacts with the VolunteerMaintenance class to ensure that only registered volunteers are assigned to events. The class provides mechanisms to handle potential errors, such as assigning volunteers who are already assigned to another event at the same time.

Reporting:

Generate Volunteer Reports: Create summary reports displaying the number of experienced and 
non-experienced volunteers within the system, providing insights into the volunteer pool.

Data Persistence:

CSV File Storage: All volunteer data and event assignments are stored in CSV files for easy access, backup, and editing. Files include VolunteerData.csv for volunteer information and Event.csv for event assignments.
Entities
Volunteer.java: Represents a volunteer, encapsulating attributes like ID, name, phone number, email, address, and experience level.
Event.java: Represents an event, storing event-specific data, including event ID, event name, and the assigned volunteers.
Data Access (DAO)
FileDao.java: This class handles reading and writing data to CSV files, ensuring data persistence.
Control
VolunteerMaintenance.java: Contains the core logic for managing volunteers and events, coordinating operations between the DAO and boundary classes.
User Interface (Boundary)
VolunteerMaintenanceUI.java: Provides a simple console interface for user interactions. Displays menus and options for managing volunteers and events.
Prerequisites
Before running the system, ensure you have the following installed:
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
CSV Libraries: The system leverages Javaâ€™s standard I/O libraries for reading and writing CSV files.

How to Run:
Compile and run the VolunteerMaintenance class in your Java IDE.
Follow the menu prompts to perform various operations, such as registering new volunteers, deleting existing volunteers, searching for volunteers, filtering volunteers, listing all volunteers, assigning volunteers to events, and generating summary reports.

How to Use:
Upon launching the application, you will be presented with the main menu that allows you to perform various operations. Below is a quick guide on how to interact with the system:
Main Menu Options
Register a New Volunteer: Enter the volunteer's details (name, phone, email, address, and experience level). A unique volunteer ID is generated, and the data is stored in the CSV file.
Delete a Volunteer by ID: Enter the ID of the volunteer you wish to delete. The system removes the volunteer from the in-memory list and updates the CSV file.
Search Volunteer by ID: Input the volunteer ID, and the system will return the volunteer's details if they are found in the CSV file.
Filter Volunteers by Experience: Choose whether to filter by "Experienced" or "Non-Experienced." The system will display a list of matching volunteers.
List All Volunteers: Shows a full list of all registered volunteers in the system, along with their details.
Assign Volunteer to an Event: Input the volunteer ID and event name to assign the volunteer to a specific event. The assignment is recorded in the Event.csv file.
View Volunteers by Event: Enter the event name, and the system will list all volunteers assigned to that event.
Generate Volunteer Report: Outputs a summary report showing the count of experienced and non-experienced volunteers.
